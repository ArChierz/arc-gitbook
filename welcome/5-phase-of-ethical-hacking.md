## :scream\_cat: Reconnaissance/Information Gathering

There are two types, Active and Passive.

### Passive

Searching things, can be someone or something interesting you found. Can be searched through **Google**, for someone can use **Linked in.** If you have some time, try learning about **Google Fu**.

### Active

Active is using the tools such as **NMAP, Nessus, Nikto,** or other tools to gain information.



## :1234: Scanning and Enumeration

* **Scanning** is part **Active** Recon, with the purpose to gain knowledges about things being scanned and look for the items that has value.
* **Enumeration** is looking through information/items more detailed about the target. For example we can looking through google to get to know about vulnerability or try out a potential payload that may be work out.



## :exploding\_head: Gaining Access / Exploitation

This part is where we run an exploit against a vulnerable machine or web app to gain access to the machine or network.&#x20;



## :mountain: Maintaining Access

This part is when we need to think about something to put or maintain access when the computer shutdown so we can still access the computer later.



## :track\_next: Covering Tracks

This way is when we clean up our tracks so there's no trace that we ever be on the computer as security purpose.
